# Algo

This repository contains various algorithm implementations in different programming languages. It serves as a collection of algorithms and data structures that can be used as references or learning resources.

## Algorithms

The following algorithms are currently included in this repository:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Each algorithm is implemented in multiple programming languages, making it easier for developers to understand and compare different language implementations.

## Usage

To use the algorithms in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AnasBaqai/Algo.git
2. Navigate to the algorithm you want to explore:
   ```shell
   cd Algo/algorithm-name
3. Choose the programming language folder and select the implementation you want to use.

4. Read the algorithm's source code and accompanying comments to understand how it works.

5. Execute or integrate the code into your own projects as needed.
